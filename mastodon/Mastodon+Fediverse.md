## Session goals
- cover Mastodon + Fediverse concepts; walkthrough i.e. show + do
    - what it is / where it came from / culture
    - how it works
        - what is Federation & ActivityPub
        - wider Fediverse
    - Apps & access
- *not* covering:
    - how to set up a Mastodon server
    - how to measure usage
    - how to do "everything" :-)
  
---
## What is it (who / where / why)

	- Mastodon started in 2016 (based on previous work / concepts)
    I've had an account since late 2016
    - Open Source
    - Federated
	- Now managed by non-profit in Germany
	- Start from joinmastodon.org

---
## Things to know
	- culture
    - where it came from
    - marginalised communities vs Twitter
	- approach to search + discovery
	- approach to "selling" on platform - not a popular approach!

---
## How does it work

	- Posts "Toots" (length)
	- no algorithm
	- Boosts
	- Replies
	- Direct messages (visibility)
	- *no ads -> support your instance directly*

---
## Content visibility

Hashtagging is useful - Hashtags are indexed / can be followed

---
## Accounts

	- settings and options
	- profile fields
	- "verification" --> verified link ownership
	- ownership / transfer to another instance
I followed this https://codingitwrong.com/2022/10/10/migrating-a-mastodon-account.html and it was fairly painless

---
## Federation

	- instances
	  - addresses (like email)
	- ActivityPub & WebFinger
	- policies
- instance policies
- blocking (policy) "fediblock"--> cautionary tales (e.g. Raspberry Pi)

	*decision point*
			use major instance | use niche instance | host own instance

## Other Fediverse services

eg.
- Video: PeerTube
- Images: Pixelfed
- Blog/longform: WriteFreely / Plume / "any" e.g WordPress now has an owned/supported plugin
- ... there are analogs for many existing "social" type services e.g. careers, music, bookmarking, etc

## Mastodon & Fediverse growth

10 million accounts as of March 2023 (from < 2 million Nov 2022)
https://the-federation.info/

Medium, Clipboard and Mozilla now all have their own presences and instances.

Multiple major entities e.g. the EU, Washington Post, etc have their own instances.

---
## Apps and access

- web view, advanced web view
- official apps
- other apps (PWA and mobile/desktop)
    - "Ivory" is an iOS app from the Tweetbot creators 
- Browser extensions
	- Graze for Chrome (and Firefox)
	- FediAct https://github.com/Lartsch/FediAct
- API & homegrown tools
    - https://mastodon-embeds.glitch.me/

## Where are my OSS / DevRel / community friends at?

Some folks are self-hosting their own instances! But, otherwise, take a look at:

	- https://fosstodon.org
	- https://hachyderm.io
	- https://techhub.social/
	- https://indieweb.social/
	- https://tech.lgbt/
	- https://floss.social/
	- https://social.coop/

Also there's a FOSS list [here](https://fedi.directory/tag/foss/) and another one [here](https://fediverse.info/explore/topics/foss)

## What about my reach?

I am not a marketer, but...

This is not a solution to the "metrics" questions, but it is pretty cool - a way to see which/how many instances receive a copy of something when you post it... https://midnight-productive-sunset.glitch.me/
